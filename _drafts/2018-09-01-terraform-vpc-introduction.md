## Learning AWS VPC essentials using Terraform

I recently passed the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate (CSAA) exam, mostly through following along with the video course from the guys at [A Cloud Guru](http://acloud.guru/). It's a great course and I recommend it to anyone wanting to take the certification. It's important for the exam to have a thorough understanding of VPC concepts and this is an area where I found just following the videos or working in the AWS console didn't really make the concepts click with me, as a coder I needed to get more hands-on.
Step forward [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) an infrastructure-as-code tool similar to AWS Cloudformation but for multi-cloud providers.
